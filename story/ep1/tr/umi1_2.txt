`Tekne bir anda titremeye başladı. `
`Limana yanaştık gibi görünüyor. `
`Teknenin sürücüsü dışarı çıktı ve bağlama halatıyla beraber iskeleye atladı. `
`Smokinli iri yarı bir adam da sıcak bir gülümsemeyle bizi bekliyordu. `
`......Onu çıkaramadım ama kıyafetlerine bakarak Ushiromiya Baş Hanesinin bir hizmetkârı olduğunu düşündüm. `
`"Hoş geldiniz, Leydim. `
`Oldukça geç kaldığınızdan endişelenmeye başlamıştım." `
`"Ah, ilgilendiğin için teşekkürler! `
`Bu moron çok korktu da, `
`biz de yavaşlamak zorunda kaldık. `
`Gerçekten sinir bozucuydu!" `
`"Ka-Kapa çeneni... Bir gün yer değiştirdiğimizde bunu hatırlayacaksın...ugghh." `
`Böyle devam ederse haber tüm aileye yayılacak ve akşam yemeğinde sohbetin en büyük konusu ben olacağım. `
`Bu olmasa bile, altı yıllık yokluğum yüzünden zaten herkes benim hakkımda konuşuyor olacaktı, ...ama şimdi onlara daha da leziz bir konu verdim...! `
`Kahretsin, Ushiromiya Baş Ailesi neden bu izole adada yaşıyor ki?! `
`Bu esnada, teknenin demirlenme işi tamamlanmıştı. `
`Tekneden inebilmemiz için küçük bir tahta koyuldu. `
`Ailelerimiz birer birer teknenin içinden çıktılar. `
`"Uzun yolculuğunuzdan dolayı hepiniz oldukça yorgun olmalısınız. `
`Madam, yardımcı olmama izin verin." `
`"Teşekkürler. `
`Uzun zaman oldu, Gohda-san. Nasılsın?" `
`"İlginiz için teşekkür ederim. `
`Hizmet etmekten her zaman memnuniyet duyarım." `
`"Battler-kun, Gohda-san ile ilk kez karşılaşıyorsun değil mi? `
`Yanılmıyorsam, altı yıl önce burada çalışmıyordun?" `
`"Doğru. `
`Bu yüzden lütfen onu ilk kez karşılamama izin verin. `
`Sizinle tanışmak bir onur, Battler-sama." `
`"......Boyum konusunda kendime güveniyorum ama sen dev gibisin. `
`...Kesinlikle ilk kez karşılaşıyoruz. `
`Senin gibi iri bir adamla tanışmış olsaydım, asla unutmazdım...! `
`Tanıştığıma memnun oldum. `
`Ben Battler." `
`"Sizinle tanışmayı dört gözle bekliyordum. `
`Ben Gohda ({p:0:郷田}), hizmetkârınız, iki yıldır Ushiromiya Baş Ailesi için çalışıyorum. `
`Sizinle tanışmak benim için bir zevk. `
`İhtiyacınız olan herhangi bir şey olursa, iletmekten çekinmeyin. Bana güvenebilirsiniz." `
`"Gohda-san, uzun zaman oldu." `
`"Çok uzun zaman oldu, George-sama. `
`Lütfen size eşlik etmeme izin verin." `
`"Her zamanki gibi misafir ağırlama konusunda profesyonelsin... `
`Eğer bir işe ihtiyacın olursa, bana haber ver, tamam mı? `
`Seni hemen işe alırım!" `
`"Beni çok onurlandırıyorsunuz. `
`Lütfen eşlik etmeme izin verin, Hideyoshi-sama." `
`Daha sonra Gohda-san, tekneden inen herkese elini uzattı ve geçerken onları karşıladı. `
`Konuşması ve tavırları bir profesyonelin kusursuzluğuna sahipti. `
`İlk bakıştaki sert görümününün aksine çok zarifti. `
`İri boyutu ilk başta biraz korkutucu görünmüştü, ama ilk izlenimimle karşılaştırıldığında çok daha kibar biriydi. `
`Adada iki yıldır hizmet ettiğini iddia ediyordu ama şüphesiz önceden de benzer bir işte çalışmıştı. `
`Herkes karaya çıktığında, bağlama halatı çözüldü ve tekne limandan uzaklaşmaya başladı. `
`Muhtemelen Niijima'daki kendi limanına dönüyordu. `
`Kaptan ellerini sallayarak veda etti. `
`Maria da ellerini bilinçli olarak sallayarak karşılık verdi. `
`"............Hmmm, şimdi düşündüm de bir süredir garip hissetmemin nedeni bu olmalı. `
`Martıların ağlamalarını duyamıyorum." `
`"Martılar? `
`Kuşlar mı?" `
`Eğer yanlış hatırlamıyorsam, eskiden bu adaya her geldiğimizde, martılar bizi hep canlı "nyaa nyaa" ağlamalarıyla karşılardı. `
`Bundan dolayı, ne zaman başka bir yerde martıların ağlamalarını duysam, bir aile konferansına geliyormuşum hissine kapılıyorum. `
`Ushiromiya Baş Ailesi'nin yaşadığı küçük kısım dışında, Rokkenjima doğal bırakıldı, bu da burayı yabani kuşlar için bir cennet haline getiriyor. `
`Söylenenlere göre, bir yerde büyük bir martı kolonisine ev sahipliği yapan bir uçurum var, bu yüzden bu ada her zaman martılarla dolu. `
`Bizi karşılayacak martıların olmayışı kendimi biraz yalnız hissetmeme neden oldu. `
`"Ne oldu, Battler-kun?" `
`"Oh, Rosa Hala. `
`...Hiç, önemli bir şey yok, sadece martıların ağlamalarını duymayınca biraz yalnız kaldığımı düşünüyordum." `
`"Aa, doğru ya, sen söyleyince fark ettim. `
`Her zaman çok gürültülü olmalarına rağmen, bugün görünürlerde yoklar." `
`"......Uu-? `
`Neden martı yok?" `
`"Hmmm, belki martılar da bir yerde bir araya gelmişlerdir? `
`Maria, martıları mı görmek istiyordun?" `
`"Uu-, görmek istiyordum." `
`"Yine de, etrafta bir tane bile olmaması biraz garip geliyor. `
`Belki Jessica hepsini kızartıp yemiştir!" `
`"......Uu-?!" `
`"Böyle rahatsız edici şeyler söyleme! `
`Maria yanlış anlayacak!!" `
`"Uu-uu-uu-! `
`Jessica onee-chan onları kızarttı, Jessica onee-chan onları kızarttı! `
`Uu-!!" `
`"Yapmadım, yapmadım! `
`Neden öyle bir şey yapayım ki?!" `
`"Öyle, öyleee, Jessica onları kızarttı! `
`Deriyle köfte, ciğerle soğaaan!" `
`"Et bebeklerde yüz! `
`Ciğerle soğaaan!! `
`Uu-uu-uu-! `
`Ahaha, ahaha! `
`Hahahaha!" `
`Jessica ile dalga geçerken, Maria da eğleniyormuşcasına peşime takıldı. `
`Ooh, onun böyle kafa dengi olacağını hiç tahmin etmezdim! `
`Peki o zaman, bugünden itibaren seni bir numaralı takipçim yapıyorum! `
`Ona gülümsediğimde, o da çok sevinçli bir şekilde gülümsedi, belli ki aramızda kurduğumuz bu minik ilişkiden mutluydu. `
`"Öyle değil, Maria-chan. `
`Yabani kuşların hava ve atmosferik basıncındaki değişimlere ayak uydurduğunu duymuştum. `
`Hava muhtemelen bu gece daha da kötüleşecek. `
`Martılar yuvalarına erken dönmüş olabilir." `
`".........Uu-. `
`Kızartmadı mı? `
`Jessica onee-chan onları kızartmadı mı?" `
`"Hayır, hayır!! `
`B-Ben öyle bir şey yapmam! `
`Battler, yalan söylediğini hemen itiraf et!" `
`"Battler-kun, `
`Maria-chan saf bir kız, bu yüzden şakaları bile ciddiye alıyor. `
`Şakalarını daha dikkatli seçmelisin." `
`...George-aniki beni nazikçe azarladı. `
`...Boy olarak Aniki'yi geçmiş olsam da, sonuçta Aniki yine Aniki'ydi. `
`Söz dinleyip özür dilemekten başka çare yoktu. `
`"P-Peki, `
`benim hatam, benim hatam... `
`Maria, bu bir şakaydı. `
`Bütün martılar bugün yuvalarında dinleniyor, hepsi bu." `
`"......Battler yalan mı söyledi? `
`George onii-chan doğruyu mu söyledi?" `
`O kadar eğlenmesine rağmen gerçekten de bu şakaya kanmış mıydı...? `
`Onun saf gözleri beni suçlu hissettirdi. `
`......Belki de biraz abartmıştım. `
`"Eeeveet, doğru, doğru. `
`George-aniki'nin dedikleri doğru. `
`Hava kötü olduğu için muhtemelen bugünlük evlerine döndüler. `
`Bu onların tamamen gitmiş oldukları anlamına gelmiyor. `
`Değil mi, Rosa Hala?!" `
`"Aynen öyle. `
`Yarın hava düzeldiğinde her zamanki "myaa myaa" ağlamalarını duyabilmemiz için geri geleceklerinden eminim." `
`"Uu-. `
`Hava düzelip onlar geri gelene kadar bekleyeceğim. `
`Yarına kadar bekleyeceğim. `
`Hava düzelene kadar bekleyeceğim. `
`Uu-uu-!" `
`Maria daha sakin bir ruh halindeydi ve martıların geri dönüp gökyüzünü dolduracağı yarını iple çekiyordu. `
`George-aniki çocuklarla ilgilenmede gerçekten bir harikaydı. `
`...Sanırım ben altı yıl önce bir veletken Aniki'nin benimle de iyi ilgilendiğini hatırlıyorum. `
`......Aniki, bu galiba senin yeteneğin. `
`"George-kun küçük çocuklarla ilgilenmekte harikasın. `
`Eğer isteseydin, eminim çocuk bakımında mükemmel bir iş çıkarırdın, sence de öyle değil mi?" `
`"Aynen, George nii-san tıpkı böyle bir şeyi yapmak için doğmuş. `
`Bence sana bir şirket başkanının ofisinde iş yapmaktan daha çok yakışırdı." `
`"Oh, yok artık. `
`Çocuk bakımı iyi bir kariyer yolu, `
`fakat yalnızca çocukları sevmenin yeterli olduğu bir iş değil." `
`"Sen gerçekten mütevazısın, George-kun. `
`Ama Battler-kun'un da çocuklarla arası oldukça iyi! `
`Daha demin çok sürmese bile, Maria çok eğleniyor gibi görünüyordu. `
`Lütfen az önce yaptığın gibi onunla oynamaya devam et. `
`Sadece şakalarını daha dikkatli seç, olur mu? `
`*kıkırdar*." `
`Rosa hala hafifçe kıkırdarken bana göz kırptı. `
`Kendi kendime; Maria'nın eğlendiğini görmekten mutluluk duyan gerçek bir anne, diye düşündüm. `
`"Hadi AMA, Rosa. `
`Ve siz veletler de neyle oyalanıyorsunuz? Hadi gidiyoruz." `
`"Tamam, tamam, geliyoruz." `
`Yaşlı piç acele etmemiz için bize el sallıyordu. `
`Evet, ilerlememiz gerekiyordu. `
`Bu konuşmayı valizlerimizi odalarımıza bıraktıktan sonra da yapabiliriz. `
`"Pekala millet, sizi geceyi geçireceğiniz konukevine kadar eşlik etmeme izin verin . `
`Lütfen, bu taraftan." `
`Gohda-san herkese seslendi ve yolu gösterdi. `
`Kumasawa-san da arkadan yetişti. `
`Bir yılan gibi kıvrımlı bu yol, loş bir ormandan geçiyordu. `
`Biraz yokuş yukarı çıkıyordu. `
`Sanırım yamaç çok dik durmasın diye yol tamamen dolambaçlı yapılmış, `
`ama şahsen, düz bir merdiven yapmaya cesaret etmiş olsalardı daha mutlu olurdum. `
`......Mesafeli ve önemliymiş havası vermek için yolu bilerek dolambaçlı yaptıklarına şüphe yok.... `
`Çok geçmeden, bahçe tarzı taş basamakları gördük. `
`...Aaah, buradan sonrasının hatırlar gibiyim. `
`Yukarı çık, ve... `
`Taş basamakların tepesinde, güzel bir konukevi göründü. `
`Binanın dışı çok güzeldi, ama daha da önemlisi, `
`......önünde yayılmış olan muhteşem gül bahçesinin ihtişamı karşısında kalplerimiz çalınmadan kapısından içeri giremedik. `
`"Aaah! `
`Bu yıl da her zamanki gibi çok zarif... `
`Gözler için gerçek bir şölen.." `
`Taş basamakları tırmandıktan sonra, bu muhteşem gül bahçesi tarafından karşılanan aile üyeleri teker teker izlenimlerini dile getirdi. `
`"Bana mı öyle geldi yoksa çiçekler bu yıl daha mı az hayat dolular? `
`Muhtemelen bu yaz o kadar da sıcak olmadığı içindir." `
`Ben de nedenlerden birinin o olduğuna inanıyorum. `
`Ne yazık ki bu yılki çiçek açma oranı geçen yıla kıyasla biraz daha düşük." `
`Öyle olsa bile, şahane bir gül bahçesiydi. `
`Altı yıl önce bile her yıl çok büyük sayıda gülün bizi karşıladığını hatırlıyorum. `
`...Bu gül bahçesi Rokkenjima'ya gelen insanları ilk karşılayan şeydi. `
`Her yıl gelen ebeveynlerimiz bile, hayranlıklarını dile getirmekten kendilerini alamıyorlardı. `
`Aslında, altı yıl önceki anılarımdaki bahçeden çok daha iyi durumda gibi görünüyordu. `
`"Bu yer her zaman muhteşem. `
`Evde böyle bir gül bahçem olsa ne güzel olurdu." `
`"Unut bunu. `
`Onlarla kimin ilgileneceğini düşünüyorsun? Güller, böcekler ve hastalıklarıyla tam bir baş belası." `
`"Duyduğum kadarıyla, `
`Kyrie nee-san her gün gülüyle ilgilenip yakınına hiçbir böceğin gelmediğinden emin oluyor, değil mi?" `
`"Huh? `
`Öyle mi? Onun böyle bir şey yaptığını bilmiyordum." `
`"Aynen öyle. `
`Gerçi bu kişiye göre gül; pis, kötü bir etobur bitki gibi böceklerin peşine düşüyor." `
`"...Oh, yani demek istediğin buydu. `
`Haydi, Rosa, sadece bugünlük rahat bıraksan? `
`Böyle şeyleri tamamen geride bıraktım." `
`"Bilemiyorum. `
`Ne de olsa, sen neredeyse genetik seviyede bir kadın avcısısın...!" `
`"Endişelenmene gerek yok, Rosa-san. `
`Bir gül sana çok fazla sorun çıkardığında, onu kökünden koparmak her zaman en iyisidir." `
`"Hohohohoh, bu ne kadar da korkutucu bir konuşma." `
`"Bayanlar arasında popüler olan adamlar hayatı her zaman tehlikeli bir şekilde yaşamaya zorlanır. `
`Umarım sonraki hayatımda birazcık daha sevimli olurum!" `
`"Hideyoshi nii-san, söylediğim gibi, hiç de öyle değil. `
`...Ve Kyrie...kes artık, beni geriyorsun. `
`Gülümü soldurdun." `
`"Hey, Maria-chan, buraya baksana. `
`Buradaki güller özellikle muhteşem." `
`"...Muhteşem güller. `
`...Uu-!" `
`"Hmmm, çok tatlı kokuyor. `
`Bak, bu zarafetime tamamen uyuyor." `
`"Hey, kes şunu! `
`Maria seni taklit edecek ve dikenler yüzünden canı yanacak!" `
`Gülün kokusunu almak için abartılı bir hareketle eğilirken bana bağırdı. `
`...Bunun aşırı bir tepki olduğunu sanmıştım, ama arkamı döndüğümde, Maria'nın her hareketimi taklit ettiğini ve George-aniki'nin bize gülümsediğini gördüm. `
`"Hey, Maria-chan, dikkat et. `
`Gülün dikenleri canını acıtabilir." `
`"......Uu-? `
`......George onii-chan, `
`bu gül diğerlerine göre garip. `
`Uu-." `
`"Garip mi? `
`Sorun ne?" `
`Maria güllerden birini işaret etti. `
`O gülü neden garip bulduğunu anında anladım. `
`Bu muhteşem güllerin arasında, tek bir gül solmaya başlamıştı. `
`Bunun özel bir nedeni yoktu. `
`Bazı güller açar, ve bazıları ise solar. `
`Hepsi buydu ama Maria aralarındaki tek sağlıksız olan için çok endişeli görünüyordu. `
`...Bu onu yalnız hissettirmiş olmalı. `
`"Yani, sağlıklı olmayan tek gül bu olduğu için mi üzgün hissediyorsun...?" `
`"......Uu-. `
`Diğer hepsi sağlıklı ama bu üzgün." `
`"Eh, hepsi kendi hızlarında çiçek açarlar ve solarlar. `
`Bahse girerim ki bu gül diğerlerinden daha önce açtığı için hepsinden önce solmaya başlıyor." `
`"Evet, aynen öyle. `
`Muhtemelen deli gibi çiçek açtı, görevini yerine getirdi ve uykuya daldı. `
`Bunun için canını sıkmamalısın." `
`".........Uu-." `
`Görünüşe göre Maria'nın saf ve hassas doğası, tek başına solan gül için duygusal bir acı hissetmesine neden oluyordu. `
`Mantığını anlamış olmasına rağmen, yine de ona yalnızlık hissi veriyordu. `
`"Pekala, Maria-chan, `
`neden gidene kadar bu güle göz kulak olmuyorsun?" `
`"Uu-?" `
`George-aniki doğruldu ve cebini yokladı. `
`Ardından uçakta yediği şekerin ambalajını çıkardı. `
`İnce bir ip şeklinde kıvırdıktan sonra bir çeşit işaretçi olması için nazikçe güle bağladı. `
`"Heeey, that's pretty cute!" `
`"Let's mark it with this. `
`Later on, you can come and give it some water. `
`I'm sure Mr. Rose will be happy." `
`"......Uu-! `
`Come to give it water!" `
`"I think you should give Mr. Rose here a name. `
`I'm sure that'll make it happy, and you'll get to know it a little better." `
`"A name...? `
`A name... `
`......Uu-uu-..." `
`Though she still wore her usual sullen face, Maria crossed her arms and began to consider this intently. `
`At the very least, she appeared to have been completely pulled out of her slump. `
`Nice going, Aniki. `
`"George nii-san has always been really understanding. `
`Can't help but respect him." `
`"Yeah. `
`I guess he was just born that way. `
`We've gotta start picking up tips!" `
`"Was this garden just as magnificent when you all were kids?" `
`"It was only after I stopped living here that it grew so big. `
`Before that, the garden was simpler, though I'm still attached to that one. `
`Nii-san fiddled with it too much, with that vaguely bad taste of his. `
`I liked it much better before." `
`"Eva, you've gotta think positive! `
`Settin' aside how it used to look, its beauty now is somethin' to be admired. `
`You'll be able to relax a lot better if you look at it that way." `
`"I didn't mean it like that... `
`I was just saying that I wanted you to see this garden the way it was before too." `
`"Everyone, if you please, `
`I shall guide you to your rooms now." `
`Gohda-san called to everyone to ask if we were ready, `
`but our hearts had been completely stolen away by the {ceviri}{gül bahçesi}rose garden that none of us had seen for a year, so we didn't pay much attention to him. `
`Since we weren't a travel group, it wasn't like we had a strict schedule to follow. `
`Besides, since our parents were visiting their old home, full of nostalgia, it wasn't like they had to let themselves be urged on by anyone or anything. `
`Understanding the situation, Gohda-san continued to wait, smiling widely, until our parents got tired of the roses and told him to guide us to our rooms... `
`"Oh...?! `
`Heeey! `
`If it isn't Kanon-kun! `
`It's been so long! How are ya doin'?!" `
`Uncle Hideyoshi suddenly shouted. `
`In the direction he was waving... `
`...was a slender boy. `
`Meeting him right after a huge man like Gohda probably emphasized his small stature. `
`The boy was in the middle of transporting piled-up gardening tools and the like in a wheelbarrow. `
`When he realized he was being called to stop, he set down the wheelbarrow, took his hat off and bowed his head. `
`"............ `
`...Good afternoon." `
`...I figured he was probably younger than me. `
`And I realized by the general atmosphere surrounding him that he was another {ceviri}{hizmetkar}servant. `
`He greeted us in response to Uncle Hideyoshi's call, but he seemed like he might be pretty unsociable most of the time. `
`It was a greeting that lacked feeling. `
`When Gohda-san noticed that our interest had shifted towards him, he went to the boy's side and introduced him to us. `
`"Battler-sama, allow me to introduce you. `
`This is one of the {ceviri}{hizmetkar}servants of the Ushiromiya Head Household. `
`...Kanon-san, greet our guest." `
`"............I'm pleased to meet you. `
`I am the {ceviri}{hizmetkar}servant......... `
`Kanon ({p:0:嘉音 `)." `
`Yep, my first impression wasn't wrong. He seemed to be unsociable, or at least not so good at talking. `
`Compared to Gohda-san, who was extraordinarily polished as a {ceviri}{hizmetkar}servant, `
`you couldn't help but feel an inexperience typical of his age. `
`When Gohda-san urged him in a whisper to give a bit more of an introduction, the boy named Kanon only cast his eyes downwards. `
`"Kanon-san, `
`could you perhaps give them a little more of a greeting...?" `
`".........No. `
`.........Because we... `
`are {ceviri}{mobilya}furniture." `
`He didn't seem to be refusing to greet us out of spite. `
`Rather, he seemed to have fallen silent because he didn't know what else to say to us in greeting. `
`"W-Well, Kanon-kun's shy and doesn't tend to talk much. `
`He might not be that sociable, but deep down he's really a good person! `
`Don't get him wrong...! `
`You've been working here for three years, haven't you? `
`Pretty sure you started a year before Gohda-san, right?" `
`Even though he wasn't exactly giving a terrible first impression, Jessica hurriedly backed him up. `
`...I see, apparently his unsociable nature causes him trouble a lot. `
`"Okay then, nice to meet you. `
`I'm Battler! `
`I'm 18. How old are you?" `
`"..........................." `
`He fell silent, as though wondering whether or not it was a question he'd have to answer. `
`...But here again, Jessica plowed ahead. `
`"Um, uhh...! `
`If I remember correctly, Kanon's two years younger than us, so...sixteen, right?" `
`".........Yes, ...that is correct." `
`It looked like he would've preferred not to tell us his age if given the choice. `
`That was probably because he thought we'd look down on him for it. `
`...I remember that when I was around his age, I hated being asked how old I was by adults. `
`...I see, sixteen huh? `
`That's gotta be a delicate time. `
`...Which means I probably asked something I shouldn't have. `
`"Heh heh, I'm glad you're about our age! `
`Just be cool and call me Battler! `
`And I'll call you Kanon!" `
`".........Thank you very much. `
`But the sentiment alone is sufficient, ...Battler-sama." `
`Jessica looked panicky for some reason. `
`She seemed to think my impression of Kanon was getting worse because of his refusal. `
`Well, as a girl, Jessica probably couldn't understand the fretful male heart at this age. `
`As his elder, even by just two years, I took it upon myself to be understanding of that. `
`"Kanon-san, could you perhaps be a little more courteous? `
`A smiling face is also part of a {ceviri}{hizmetkar}servant's duty." `
`"...............My apologies. `
`...I shall make an effort." `
`"Hohohoh... `
`Gohda-san, Kanon-kun is trying his best, yes?" `
`It looked like he was often warned about being unsociable. `
`And apparently he hadn't improved one bit. `
`Gohda-san kept his business smile but let a small sigh of resignation escape. `
`"...Well then, I still have work to do. `
`......If you'll excuse me." `
`It looked like Kanon himself was uncomfortable with remaining silent here any longer. `
`After another perfunctory bow, he turned around and started pushing the wheelbarrow again. `
`Just then, the wheelbarrow suddenly wobbled and fell, scattering the load. `
`I guess the wheelbarrow's single wheel got caught on a pebble and lost its balance. `
`"What do you think you're doing...? Now, now, clean it up quickly...!" `
`Gohda-san urged him to hurry in a quiet voice, as though hinting that it was shameful for a {ceviri}{hizmetkar}servant to appear clumsy in front of guests. `
`Kanon-kun wordlessly reloaded the wheelbarrow with the fallen objects, as if to say that he understood quite well without being told. `
`He seemed to be fine with the light-looking gardening tools, shovels and such, but he looked like he was having trouble getting his arms around and lifting up some sacks of fertilizer. `
`"Are you okay? You're so careless. `
`Here." `
`"{ceviri}{Leydim}Milady, you will dirty your garments. `
`Please, leave this to us." `
`With a smooth motion, Gohda-san took the shovel that Jessica had picked up. `
`Behind him, Kanon-kun was having trouble with the sacks of fertilizer. `
`"......Uu-. `
`You'll dirty your garments?" `
`"Don't worry, the ones I'm wearing aren't that expensive. `
`Besides, I hate guys who just sit there and make the waitress pick up the fork they dropped at a restaurant." `
`I lifted up the other bags that had fallen. `
`Of course, they weren't light, but for me it was a piece of cake. `
`Kanon-kun looked at me, surprised. `
`It was the face of someone who never would've expected to receive help from a guest. `
`"............B-Battler-sama, `
`don't worry about it... I will take care of everything, so..." `
`"Don't you worry! `
`I may not look it, but I've got it where it counts! `
`Heheh!" `
`Since Kanon-kun looked like he hadn't yet gone through his growth spurt, he was stuck with a sorta weak body. `
`This kind of weight might've been too much for him. `
`"It's quite heavy. `
`It's natural that it would be difficult for you. `
`Don't worry about it, Kanon-kun." `
`"Okay, my time to shine. `
`This makes up for the boat stuff from before, right?" `
`"Ha! `
`As if this could make up for freaking out like that! `
`Ahahaha! `
`Later, I'll tell you about it too, Kanon-kun! Battler was totally hilarious!" `
`"Gonna faaall, faaall!! `
`Uu-uu-uu-!!!" `
`As they did this, I piled all the stuff back into the wheelbarrow. `
`"............I beg your forgiveness...for letting you witness such unsightliness." `
`"Come now, that's quite enough. `
`Please, go." `
`Letting the guests, who were supposed to feel welcome, see such a disgraceful thing... must have been hideously embarrassing for a {ceviri}{hizmetkar}servant. `
`Pressed by Gohda to hurry up and go, Kanon-kun left. `
`"You're too harsh on him, Gohda-san. `
`Shouldn't you have helped him, instead of being a bully?" `
`"...That was wrong of me. `
`I deeply implore your forgiveness." `
`Without even a twitch in his smile, Gohda-san apologized elegantly. `
`"Kanon-kun has a ton a things he's good at too. `
`It's just that bein' young works against him all the time. `
`It's a cryin' shame." `
`"Well, it's a prickly age. `
`Let's just leave him be. `
`After all, closed-mouthed {ceviri}{hizmetkar}servants are the best kind. `
`Isn't that right, Kumasawa-san?" `
`"Hohohohoh, Rudolf-sama, you truly are harsh! `
`There is no {ceviri}{hizmetkar}servant as silent as me, of course!" `
`Everyone smiled wryly at that obvious lie. `
`Even she herself didn't believe that, not in her wildest dreams. `
`So, she must've said it to lighten the mood. `
`Yeah, that's the kind of character Kumasawa baa-chan used to be. `
`The once stiff atmosphere had cleared up at once thanks to her cheerful smile. `
`"I'd like to set down our luggage soon. `
`Gohda-san, what rooms are we all going to take?" `
`"It shall be the same as the previous year. `
`Allow me to guide you. `
`Please, this way." `
`We headed towards a trim, elegantly simple {ceviri}{konukevi}guesthouse. `
`This was gonna be our temporary quarters for the night. `
`".........................................." `
`Kanon watched over a hedge as the guests all entered the {ceviri}{konukevi}guesthouse. `
`Then, he let his eyes fall on those heavy sacks of fertilizer, piled up in the wheelbarrow. `
`In his mind, he kept going over his previous mistake. `
`Battler, big and strong, had picked up the sacks in front of him, the sacks Kanon couldn't lift himself, as if they were feathers. `
`It would be extremely difficult for an outside observer to guess what emotions that favor had stirred up in Kanon. `
`But as far as you could tell by watching him hang his head, there was something that he just couldn't let go of. `
`...Muttered words escaped his lips. `
`But those words he murmured were so soft that they didn't reach even his own ears. `
`...............Even I... `
`.................." `
`Kanon hung his head, slightly biting his lower lip... `
`"I remember the {ceviri}{gül bahçesi}rose garden, `
`...but I don't remember this {ceviri}{konukevi}guesthouse at all. `
`Was it built recently?" `
`"Toraian" (Visitor's Retreat) was written on a gatepost-like thing, but since everyone called it the {ceviri}{konukevi}guesthouse, I followed their lead. `
`The brand-new Western-style {ceviri}{konukevi}guesthouse, which stood overlooking the roses, had a magnificent design carefully done in harmony with the garden. `
`"Correct! `
`It was built the year before last. `
`Ever since then, they've had us sleep over here." `
`"Heheh, this place is more fun than that junky old {ceviri}{malikane}mansion you knew. `
`I wish my room was over here!" `
`"Uu-! `
`I want a room here too! `
`I want one!" `
`...I guess you could say my own house was upper-class, but to me, it felt completely ordinary compared to the {ceviri}{Baş Aile}Head Family. `
`The display of wealth was shocking, as was the fact that they'd build this kind of awesome {ceviri}{konukevi}guesthouse for guests who came over only a few times a year. `
`"Eva-sama, Hideyoshi-sama, `
`please, do make use of this room. `
`Rudolf-sama, Kyrie-sama, please take this room here." `
`"I really do love how beautiful and elegant this place is. `
`Western-style architecture truly is wonderful." `
`"I can handle Western design for a few days, but any longer than that and you need the good old Japanese look! `
`Japanese people just relax best on tatami mats." `
`"...Haha, they've been fighting over whether to make our new house Japanese-style or Western-style. `
`Mom still holds a grudge about Dad having the construction started with a Japanese layout, and they bicker all the time about it." `
`"I'm really jealous, George nii-san. Your parents get along well, don't they? `
`Mine are so frosty. `
`Then again, they're always in sync when it comes to my grades." `
`All the rooms seemed to be for two people. `
`I was grateful, since I wasn't gonna be forced to share the same room with the old bastard, under the pretext that we were family. `
`And anyway, I figure those two wouldn't be able to enjoy themselves with someone like me around, ihihi. `
`"What's with that creepy smile? `
`You're thinking about something dirty, aren't you?" `
`"Ihihihi! `
`Something diiirrrty? Of cooouuurse not! `
`Please enjoy your staaay! `
`Ow, owowowow! `
`That hurts, you old bastard!" `
`Once again, Dad pulled my ears from behind. `
`"Cut the crap. `
`I'm getting a stomachache, and I'm not in the mood for this. `
`You're the guest of honor this time around, `
`so play as nice as possible with Dad and Aniki and the rest. `
`......At the very least, be careful of what you say in front of Dad, got it? `
`Because wisecracks don't go too well with him. `
`......Jessica-chan, what's the Head's mood been like lately?" `
`"...Hmm...... `
`Same as last year, I guess. `
`......Considering they say he's got three months left to live, he's as lively, `
`grumpy, `
`and irritable as ever." `
`"Meaning, this year he's in his usual bad mood. `
`......And as usual, the only one who's able to look after him is Genji-san?" `
`"It seems the Master will open his heart to no one else. `
`Lately, us small people have not even been granted an audience with him..." `
`"He's shut himself up in his {ceviri}{çalışma odası}study again, probably doing nothing but that weird black {ceviri}{büyü}magic of his. `
`What he does for a hobby is his own damn business, but when he starts stinking up the house, it really gets on my nerves. `
`...I wish he'd never come out of that {ceviri}{çalışma odası}study again. `
`Heheheh!" `
`"You shouldn't talk like that about the elderly. `
`We're all indebted to him, since he rebuilt the Ushiromiya Family. We should be more grateful." `
`"Hm, ...well... `
`......Sorry." `
`After being rebuked by George-aniki, Jessica had no choice but to take back her thoughtless remark. `
`The Ushiromiya family was wealthy beyond belief, but of course, that meant all its members were a bit strange...and completely out of touch with the world at large. `
`And at the top of the chain, the {ceviri}{Aile Reisi}Family Head--our Grandfather--seemed especially strange and terrifying, even for our family. `
`Dad said he was getting a stomachache earlier, ...and I imagine that reflected the honest feelings of all the adults here today. `
`No doubt they were jealous of us grandchildren, who could just play around and laugh without a care. `
`From the stories Dad told me, the {ceviri}{Aile Reisi}Family Head was a violent man who ruled with his fists, beating his children, even his daughters, mercilessly with a wooden sword. `
`If he was so strict and uptight about that, why couldn't he have been a little more conservative with his kids' names? `
`Because of that, even us grandkids have had to suffer. `
`...Anyway, I can't say I have any trouble believing those terrifying stories about him. `
`I don't remember meeting him very often, but I think I recall him looking extremely grumpy all the time, always making people cower with that sharp gaze of his. `
`I remember that the room's atmosphere got so tense whenever he was around, you couldn't even breathe. `
`What my dad said about me being the guest of honor now carries a little more oomph for me. `
`".........Six years ago I was in elementary school, but I'm a high-schooler now. `
`If I act up, things could get serious. `
`...Oooh, scary." `
`"He does look frightening, but he's not so terrifying that you need to tense up like that. `
`Nothing of what he says is truly unreasonable. `
`He may be clumsy at talking, but he's a very logical person." `
`"But George nii-san, you've been the family darling since like forever because of your awesome grades, right? `
`Grandfather treats us completely different! `
`I've even gotten slapped with a wooden sword. `
`On my ass, my ass! `
`On my maidenly, innocent ass!" `
`"Well, you're the heiress of the {ceviri}{Baş Aile}Head Family, Jessica-chan. `
`Grandfather is giving you special attention. `
`You've got to realize that his strictness reflects his high hopes for you." `
`"Oh, come on. `
`...Seriously, I could just turn the succession over to you, George nii-san. `
`It's a bit of a heavy burden for me to carry." `
`I think I already said it before, but Jessica's the girl heir to the {ceviri}{Baş Aile}Head Family. `
`We're only cousins in branch families, so she probably feels a totally different sort of pressure than we do. `
`".........Uu-? `
`Jessica onee-chan, is that heavy? `
`If I help hold it, will it get lighter?" `
`"Hmm? `
`Ahahahaha, thanks. `
`It's okay, I'm not gonna push it on you, Maria. `
`......I'm gonna bear this cross until my grave. `
`...Don't worry." `
`She was grateful for Maria's innocent concern, but Jessica's face still seemed to contain some of the uneasiness she felt towards the future. `
`...Maybe we were in the same boat. `
`Any high-schooler with exams approaching would have trouble hiding their anxiety for the future. `
`"Maria, come here. `
`You and I will be in this room." `
`"Battler-kun, I heard you're gonna be with me in this room here." `
`"Oh? `
`Now there's a surprise! `
`It's bigger than our parents' rooms, dang!" `
`"Well, I figured we cousins would all want to hang out together, `
`so I told them to get a bigger room ready." `
`"Uu-! `
`I like it here more too! `
`I'd rather be here than with Mama! `
`Uu-uu-!" `
`"Oh, you like it better here too, Maria?! `
`Okay, this room is George's and mine, but we'll give you special permission to come in! `
`Better keep it a secret from your mom, okay?" `
`"Uu-! `
`It's a secret!" `
`{ceviri}{Hala}Aunt Rosa was right behind us, but Maria still answered, striking the air with her fists clenched tight. `
`After setting down their luggage in their rooms, our parents had gathered again in the corridor. `
`"Hey, what are you brats planning to do? `
`Are you cousins just gonna stay here and chat?" `
`It seemed they were heading to the {ceviri}{malikane}mansion to announce their arrival. `
`...Normally, they would make us follow them and greet everyone together, `
`but if that had been the case, Dad would've just told us to come, and that'd be the end of it. `
`He's saying it's okay if we don't come, so what'll we do? `
`"Well, it's gonna be lunchtime before long anyway. `
`Better let the kids unwind here. `
`Besides, if worst comes to worst, this might be their last chance to play outdoors." `
`"Uu-! `
`I'll go too!" `
`"Maria, you house-sit for Mama, okay? `
`Behave yourself and wait here." `
`"......Uu-." `
`Since Maria was being told to house-sit here, we certainly couldn't leave her on her own. `
`George-aniki noticed this immediately and gave a clear reply for all of us cousins. `
`"Well then, we'll accept your offer and house-sit. `
`We've got lots of stories to tell each other, after being away for a year." `
`"That sounds wonderful. `
`And Battler-kun has six years' worth of stories to tell, doesn't he?" `
`"Yeah, yeah. `
`I'll take care of the house like a good boy." `
`"Kumasawa-san, I'm gonna stay here too! `
`We'll break rank and leave the rest to the adults, heheheh!" `
`"Perhaps that would be best, hohohoh. `
`I'll report it to Madam..." `
`"Then allow me to guide you all to the {ceviri}{malikane}mansion. `
`This way, please." `
`"...The other children are one thing, but George is getting to be an adult. Wouldn't it be better if he came with us?" `
`"If we make him come, then poor George will be the only one out of place. `
`Interactin' with his cousins is also important. `
`Okay, see ya'll later!" `
`The adults left one after the other. `
`They left in the same formation as our trip from the harbor, with Gohda-san leading and Kumasawa-san taking up the rear. `
`As we gathered in the room assigned to us cousins, George-aniki asked us to excuse him for a second. `
`He rushed over to Kumasawa-san, who was following behind the disappearing adults, and seemed to ask her something. `
`He soon finished his business and came back. `
`"What's up, Aniki?" `
`"Ah, nothing. `
`I just wanted to ask her something." `
`"Uu-! `
`Tell me too! `
`Tell me too!" `
`"...Hmm? `
`Heheheheh. `
`What could George nii-san be asking Kumasawa-san and not me, I wonder? `
`Ah, I don't have a clue!" `
`"No, it's a misunderstanding...! `
`...Not that I know what you're misunderstanding...!" `
`Aniki was getting pretty tongue-tied. `
`It was almost as though he felt guilty about something, and Jessica knew exactly what he was worried about. `
`At any rate, it's no fun if Jessica gets to know about it and not me! `
`"Hey, Maria, it looks like we're the only two out of the loop, right? `
`Don't you wanna know what they're talking about?!" `
`"Uu-! `
`We wanna know too! `
`We wanna know too!" `
`""Uu-uu-uu-uu-!!!"" `
`I fooled around while "uu"-ing together with Maria. `
`"No, I'm telling you... It's no big deal, ahahaha..." `
`"Liar! `
`I'm surprised you'd tell such a terrible lie, Aniki. Confess! `
`Maria, you tickle his right side, I'll tickle his left!" `
`"Uu-! `
`I've got his right side, Battler's got his left! `
`Uu-!" `
`"Wait a second!! `
`Wait, you two...!! `
`Ahahaha, stop, `
`ahahahahahaha!!" `
`Maria and I played around, chasing George-aniki as he tried to escape, rolling on the bed. `
`I realize high-schoolers aren't supposed to bounce around like kittens, but I still missed this kind of fun. `
`A warm, cozy kind of fun. `
`"Haahahahaha, George nii-san, what were you asking Kumasawa-san? `
`Hmm? `
`Well, I've got a good guess. `
`It's been a year since the last time he visited the {ceviri}{Baş Aile}Head Family. `
`Who knows what {ceviri}{hizmetkar}servants might've come and gone during that time? Either way, it looks like he'd like to go and say hi." `
`"......Uu-? `
`Say hi, I wanna to say hi too!" `
`"What the hell, that's nothing to feel guilty about, Aniki. `
`......Hmmmm? `
`I'm not buying it. `
`Maria, don't be fooled, Aniki's still hiding something! `
`More torture!! `
`Uworyaaa!!" `
`"S-Stop it, seriously! `
`Aahahahahaha! `
`Maria-chan, you too, stop already!!" `
`"Aahahahahaha, aahahahahaha! `
`Hahahaha!!" `
`"She's probably busy cleaning or getting lunch ready. `
`Don't worry, she'll drop by to say hi sooner or later. `
`Heh, I'll bet you'd rather've been welcomed in by Shannon instead of that nosy Gohda. `
`Heheheh!" `
`"Shannon? `
`......Shannon. `
`...Aaaaahh... `
`Yeah, I remember a girl with that name! `
`Is she still a {ceviri}{hizmetkar}servant? `
`How's she doing?!" `
`"By the way, Natsuhi nee-san, `
`how's your headache been lately? `
`It seemed pretty serious before." `
`"...I have been much better lately. `
`Thank you for your concern." `
`"Oh, right. Here. `
`A present for you, Natsuhi nee-san." `
`"......Thank you very much. `
`I'm always receiving gifts from you. `
`...Is this black tea?" `
`"It's herb tea with peppermint and lemon balm. `
`It's a blend from a well-known store, and it's supposed to be good for headaches. `
`I thought it might help you too." `
`Rosa was always a conscientious woman. `
`...Probably because she was the youngest of four and much younger than the other three, `
`she managed to grow up without gaining the venomous nature of her siblings. `
`Her kind words got Natsuhi to soften her expression for just a moment, `
`but it wasn't enough to melt her stony gaze, hardened as it was by long years of mental stress. `
`"Come to think of it, you're always complaining about those headaches. `
`Pull yourself together. `
`Jessica-chan has her exams this year, right? `
`That's going to be a turning point in her life. `
`Will she really be able to rely on you as a mother if you're like that? `
`Besides, Natsuhi nee-san, you're three years younger than me. `
`You should get your act together." `
`"............ `
`.........I apologize. `
`I've had a tendency for headaches all my life." `
`Even under normal circumstances, Eva sometimes failed to choose her words carefully, but her comments aimed at Natsuhi contained shards of obvious malice, though she hid it with a smile. `
`Of course, that fact didn't escape Natsuhi. `
`She frantically contained her urge to grimace and pretended to ignore Eva. `
`"Our Battler-kun will have his exams this year too. `
`Rudolf-san, shouldn't you be a little concerned as well? `
`For the sake of your own son, you'd better get serious to the point of having headaches like Natsuhi nee-san." `
`"If I say anything, he automatically rebels. `
`So what should I say? Should I say the opposite, that it's okay for him to mess around? `
`That's probably the only way I could get him to listen to me. `
`Hideyoshi nii-san, George did really well on his exams, right? `
`Please, you've gotta teach me the trick to handling children." `
`"Hmm, well... `
`It's probably because I got him to understand why he should {ceviri}{çalışma odası}study! `
`Study isn't worth anything on its own. `
`That's right, the real point of studyin' is to practice researchin' stuff on your own whenever you bump into something ya don't know! `
`If ya can't do that, ya can't be useful to society! `
`I'm not talkin' about math or writin'. `
`Ya gotta learn how to learn!" `
`"...That's splendid. `
`I wish our Jessica could understand that as well. `
`If she is to be the heiress of the Ushiromiya family, then at this rate-" `
`"Do you really have to force her into becoming the successor? `
`After all, a woman has to find a woman's happiness. `
`Parents shouldn't force such things on their children, don't you think?" `
`"Hold your horses, Eva. `
`Each family has its own way of raising their kids. `
`You shouldn't be pushy." `
`"I'm sorry. `
`Natsuhi nee-san, don't take it the wrong way." `
`"..........................." `
`Though the light shining in through the window was quite warm despite the cloudy weather, there was a dark mood about the room, `
`...which was probably causing headaches for more than just Natsuhi. `
`As if to sweep away that mood, Kyrie brightly made a suggestion to all present. `
`"Still, this black tea has a really lovely aroma. `
`Let's drink it right away. `
`In Japan, surely you couldn't find something like Leopold's black tea anywhere but Ginza, right?" `
`"I see you know a lot about it, Kyrie nee-san. `
`I guess it was worth going to the trouble of buying it." `
`Kyrie and Rosa stood up from their seats and made as if to prepare the black tea, `
`but Natsuhi forestalled them. `
`"......I thank you both, `
`but we can try that later. `
`One of our people will soon be coming to bring some tea, so please relax." `
`"Leave it for later, you two. `
`Let's enjoy our "welcome drink"." `
`Rudolf gave a subtle signal with his eyes for them to sit down again. `
`...Kyrie and Rosa understood instantly and obediently returned to their seats. `
`The initial greeting of the guests was complete, so it was time for them to be served some tea. `
`...It was embarrassing for the host that the tea was late, especially now that the guests were talking about making tea themselves. `
`Natsuhi bit her lower lip, frustrated by the ineptitude of the {ceviri}{hizmetkar}servants who were late bringing in the tea. `
`...Seeing her face, Eva immediately started to giggle. `
`......Of course, Shannon had no way of knowing what was taking place in the {ceviri}{salon}parlor. `
`She came pushing a serving cart piled with tea cups. `
`For no apparent reason, Natsuhi gave her a pained look, and Shannon couldn't help but flinch without knowing what she had done wrong. `
`"......E-Excuse me. `
`Your tea is ready." `
`"Oh, Shannon-chan, it's been a while! `
`You keep getting prettier every time I see you!" `
`".........Oh, `
`...um, `
`.........thanks..." `
`"Save the chatting for after you've set the table. `
`The tea will get cold." `
`"......I-I apologize, Madam." `
`She apologized like a small frightened animal, bumped against the serving cart, and made a jarring racket as she dropped several teaspoons. `
`Her clumsiness made Natsuhi's expression turn even darker, which made Shannon quail even more. `
`"Come on, Natsuhi nee-san. `
`There's nothing wrong with her exchanging a few words in greeting. `
`The tea must be plenty cold already, considering how long we've been kept waiting. `
`Heheheh." `
`"Th-There's no need to worry... `
`It's not cold yet..." `
`".........Shannon, finish setting the table, quickly." `
`"I-I'm sorry, Madam......" `
`Natsuhi's irritation was obvious by now. `
`...The ineptitude that delayed the tea, the clumsiness of the {ceviri}{hizmetkar}servant... Everything pointed to the incompetence of Natsuhi's everyday leadership, making her lose face. `
`As the person in charge of the {ceviri}{Ushiromiya Baş Ailesi}Ushiromiya Head Family's kitchen, allowing that clumsiness to be exposed--today of all days--was surely nothing less than total humiliation. `
`"Lay off, Natsuhi nee-san. `
`Don't you think it's a little harsh to bully Shannon-chan when she's trying her best?" `
`"I'm not bullying anyone...!" `
`"What a nice aroma. `
`May I ask what brand this is?" `
`"............Umm, `
`I'm terribly sorry... `
`I'll find out for you later..." `
`Kyrie was trying to be nice, hoping to cut through the tense mood. `
`...However, Shannon had embarrassed herself instead, darkening Natsuhi's face and the room's mood. `
`By this point, Eva was audibly giggling. `
`"Whaat's this? `
`Shannon-chan, don't you even know what you're pouring us? `
`Come now, you mustn't serve something so suspicious to guests. `
`We'll need a silver spoon at the very least before we can drink this." `
`"...I-I'm sorry... `
`I'll go get one immediately..." `
`"Shannon-chan, `
`do you know what silver spoons are used for? `
`They have to be silver. `
`Do you know why?" `
`"......No, `
`...umm..." `
`A teasing smile rose to Eva's face as she stared at Shannon setting the table. `
`By itself, Eva's expression was sweet in an impish sort of way. `
`However, the words being spun from her lips held the keenness of a razor within them. `
`Shannon tried with all her might to avoid Eva's continuing gaze. `
`Realizing that Shannon was hard-pressed for an answer, Rosa gave some timely help. `
`"They say that if silver is touched by poison, it darkens. `
`...*giggle* Guess you've learned something today, Shannon-chan." `
`They were acting as though this tea needed to be tested for poison before it could be drunk. `
`In Natsuhi's eyes, this was an insult both to the tea...and to herself for serving it. `
`Rudolf laughed flippantly and patted Eva's shoulder. `
`"Haha, silver cutlery wouldn't do any good for you, Aneki. `
`Just one lick of your poisonous tongue, and even a silver plate would turn pitch black." `
`"Wahahahaha! `
`Since I get to hear that poison tongue every day, I must be poison-proof myself by now! `
`Eva, I don't mind when you use it on me, but you'd better hold back when talking to people who haven't built up a resistance! `
`Wahahahaha!" `
`"My, how cruel. `
`All I did was teach Shannon-chan a bit about tea, didn't I? `
`*giggle*" `
`Everyone followed the lead set by Hideyoshi's horselaugh and chuckled, though not easily. `
`Only Natsuhi didn't join in, but for the time being, the conversation inside the {ceviri}{salon}parlor could now be mistaken for a lively and friendly chat. `
`As Shannon finally finished setting the tea table and tried to leave, Kyrie apologized to her in a low voice for not being able to help. `
`...Shannon gave a light bow and made a hasty retreat...... `
`Shannon cast her eyes downwards as she pushed the cart down the corridor... `
`Anyone seeing the pitiful way she looked might easily conclude that she'd been bullied in some way. `
`"...Don't be sad. `
`You didn't do anything wrong, Nee-san." `
`"......You were watching." `
`"That is my role." `
`".................." `
`"Madam and Eva-sama can go to hell. `
`......But the worst coward is that guy." `
`Kanon glared hatefully in the opposite direction of the {ceviri}{salon}parlor. `
`The preparations for the tea had been delayed by some trifling problems in the kitchen. `
`These problems were not Shannon's fault. `
`In fact, it had been Gohda's mistake. `
`After all, there was no way a showoff like Gohda would give up a flashy job like bringing in tea when the guests arrived. `
`He had ended up wasting time preparing the tea once again. `
`So, when he realized he wouldn't be able to score any points for this job, he pushed the task of setting the table on Shannon, who happened to be passing by. `
`...You might call it a clever move on his part, but there could be no doubt that it was a cowardly one. `
`"......It's okay, Kanon-kun. Thanks. `
`I'm not bothered by it at all..." `
`"................................." `
`Kanon's silence vividly expressed the distance between Shannon's words and how she actually felt. `
`"......Thank you. `
`Even if you're the only one who understands, I feel a bit better." `
`"......You keep your feelings too bottled up, Nee-san. `
`......You should be less hard on yourself for once." `
`"Yeah. `
`......Thanks." `
`Suddenly, they both felt someone's presence and whirled around. `
`A middle-aged man stood there. `
`It was Genji, the head {ceviri}{hizmetkar}servant. `
`".........What are you doing there? `
`...Shannon, hurry back to the kitchen." `
`"Y-Yes. `
`......If you'll excuse me......" `
`"................................." `
`Shannon humbly obeyed and promptly made to push the cart and leave. `
`However, Kanon appealed to Genji in silence, bearing something in his eyes that he could not express in words. `
`"......What is it? `
`Did something happen...?" `
`"...Sh- `
`Shannon didn't do anything wrong. `
`But even so, they..." `
`"Stop it, Kanon-kun... `
`...Please excuse me. `
`I'll return to work immediately. `
`Kanon-kun, you should go back to your post too. `
`......Please." `
`"......If you say so, Nee-san." `
`"............ `
`...If that is all, then go." `
`"...Yes. `
`...If you'll excuse me." `
`From the shadows in the hallway, an old woman wearing an apron watched over them.  It was Kumasawa... `
`......Poor Shannon-san, Kanon-san... `
`There's no reason for those two to be picked on. `
`...Still, Gohda-san's dislike for them is an undeniable fact... `
`Until Gohda-san was taken in by the {ceviri}{Ushiromiya Baş Ailesi}Ushiromiya Head Family, I hear he worked for a fabulous hotel somewhere. `
`The manner of work he learned there was quite impressive, I believe. `
`It's just that...Gohda-san is the newest {ceviri}{hizmetkar}servant here. `
`...He must have a lot of pride accumulated from his previous positions. `
`Because Shannon-san and Kanon-kun are his seniors here at the {ceviri}{malikane}mansion, and yet are inexperienced and have gone through much less in life than he has, he picks on them at every chance he gets... `
`And also, ...sad as it may be, they are disliked by Madam Natsuhi too... `
`Of course, if we're talking about experience, the Madam has been in this family much longer. `
`And yet...this is one point where I cannot help but sympathize with the Madam as well. `
`...Truly, the Master is a man with many sins on his conscience... `
`Why didn't he realize that such a trifling whim of his would give the Madam such an inferiority complex...? `
`...Of course, on the inside, even the Madam is fully aware that those two don't deserve to be treated so harshly... `
`...However, the heart has reasons that reason knows not... `
`Aah, I feel so sorry for them... `
`I can't do anything but watch over them from the shadows...... `
